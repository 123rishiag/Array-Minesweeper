# Array Minesweeper

## Overview
Welcome to **Minesweeper**, a classic puzzle game that combines strategy and quick thinking. In this project, we'll recreate this iconic game using C++ and SFML, diving deep into game mechanics and 2D arrays to deliver an engaging experience.

## Features
- **Grid Mechanics**: 
  - Navigate a grid of cells to uncover safe areas and avoid mines.
  - Use clues from adjacent cells to locate hidden mines.
- **Mine Detection**: 
  - Reveal cells to gather information about nearby mines.
  - Flag suspected mines to avoid triggering them.
- **Game State Management**: 
  - Handle game state transitions smoothly, including win and lose conditions.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Data Structures**: Gained hands-on experience with 2D arrays, crucial for implementing grid-based games like Minesweeper.
- **Game Logic**: Developed an understanding of game mechanics and state management.
- **User Interface**: Designed and implemented an intuitive UI to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Event Handling**: Created responsive controls for smooth and engaging gameplay.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Enhanced understanding of OOP principles and practices.
- **Game Loop and State Management**: Maintained fluid transitions and consistent game state throughout the gameplay.
